This is a program that verifies the solution printed by a parallel conjugate gradients program. It computes a dot product of a solution and each row of the coefficients matrix and prints it along with matching constant.

This program takes to arguments: the task file and the solution printed by conjugate gradients program. It can be compiled with any C++ compiler and run.

This is not a parallel program.
